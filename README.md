# Portfolio
My simple portfolio built in raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript

[Live Demo](https://johnnyjaywu.github.io/portfolio/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project is designed with the intention of quick and accessible content delivery. Each content is intentionally designed to occupy a majority of the viewport, avoiding an overload of information for the user. Navigation is kept simple and persistent to minimize clicks.

## Optimizations

Currently, content is statically injected. Ideally, a system for dynamic content delivery is desired. Knowing that the content would be updated frequently, I should be utilizing a database to update future content.

## Lessons Learned:

As I continue to update and refine the website, this project will continue to be a playground for me to expand my skills in both frontend and backend techonologies.
